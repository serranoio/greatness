That's it. Everything else has been decided

## PMF
1. We need to be researching the PMF the whole time. Because our product is reflected by the PMF.
### Industry
* What is out there
	* What features can we copy
	* What features suck ass. Just absolute ass
* What isn't out there
	* Think of ideas and why they are not there.
* The state of the industry
	* List of companies doing what
	* Make a mental map of all competition in all segments of industry
## Research
* EBook
	* Reread specification. Understand it in and out.
* Volunteer
	* Investigate how Volunteer Match is able to get 501c orgs to "Claim" their company
	* MAYBE we could integrate our features into their data. They have the data. We have the engineering.
